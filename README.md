# YTMP4

YTMP4 is a web app that allows you to stream YouTube videos as MP4s, bypassing things like monitoring extensions
and YouTube sign-in. It's also helpful if you want to download a youtube video, but fair warning: that's against YouTube's TOS.

Please only download videos with the consent of the content creator.
